## Why do you want to work at GitHub?

I’m a fan of GitHub’s product design. The code-centered approach is revolutionary. Having the ability to easily put code online, allow others to conveniently browse it and its history, submit patches and create discussions in context brought collaboration in programming to a whole new level. Everything works as intended, with minimal effort and a low barrier for the community to access.

I also admire how GitHub became so successful by investing in open source software. Everybody relies on open source. By charging those who profit from proprietary software, while giving free service to the open source community, GitHub contributes to make the game fairer, and at the same time promotes the growth and earns the engagement of the community that makes it so strong.

Programming is my art. I think it’s beautiful, I enjoy programming and I express myself through it. For this reason, I’d like to make the experience of programming better, both by improving the tools and growing the community that made it accessible to me.

Furthermore, I feel reassured by GitHub’s affirmative stance towards diversity and inclusion, which are often neglected by companies. I want to work in an environment that brings out my best and, especially being a transgender brazilian person living in the UK, diversity and inclusion are very important to me.

## Why do you feel you would be a fit for this role?

As a resourceful, creative, and critically thinking programmer, who's both autonomous and collaborative, interested in optimization, cares about diversity and inclusion and has 6 years of professional Ruby on Rails experience, I'm confident that I have the necessary skills and that the role and GitHub's culture are what I'm looking for.

### Work optimization and critical thinking

I care about optimizing tools, processes and work as a whole, making solutions more performant, available and maintainable. To achieve that, I naturally involve people in technical discussions to critically think about tradeoffs and make sensible, evidence-based decisions that meet users' real needs.

This interest is manifest in all my work as a programmer: it comprehends implementing complex algorithms to speed up video games, writing tools to maintain linux distros and tailoring software to best fit clients' business objectives.

For example, I was a developer in an MVP (Ruby on Rails) to help clinicians from a hospital to monitor their patients remotely, which involved sending questionnaires to be completed online.

I had a discussion with the senior developer about the database schema and we had some options to choose from. I feared they were complicated and risky, either delivering unacceptable performance at scale or potentially stalling development due to programming obstacles, and we hadn’t even tested a prototype with real patients yet.

I challenged a requirement everybody took for granted: making the questionnaires dynamic and customizable by the clinicians. I convinced the team and the client that starting with a single hardcoded questionnaire would save us from those complexities and risks, allowing us to test sooner and think about the abstraction later, with real data in hand.

The project was successful, the app was fast and scaled well. We even had a project extension and, in the end, the client never had the dynamic questionnaire feature prioritized.

### Diversity and inclusion

I also have a life commitment to discussing diversity and inclusion, which I also bring to work. In the project mentioned above, I convinced the client and shipped a feature to make the system more inclusive by making it address (transgender) people by their preferred names.

### Autonomy and collaboration

Most of my skills were acquired on the internet and doing personal projects. Being self-taught, I’m used to working autonomously, finding solutions on my own and reaching out for community help when needed.

In another experience, working with a local council to improve a system used by their housing repairs call center, the team had to substitute part of a slow, proprietary software, by building new APIs (dotnet) and frontends (Ruby on Rails) to its database.

The software had little documentation, the people who knew it well had left the council and the original developer was taking too long to respond. We were blocked.

While waiting for an external response, I asked around the council, tracked some people who had useful knowledge and chased the council’s developers, driving discussions and proposing experiments to reverse engineer the system.

In the end, most of the progress was due to the teams' combined efforts at reverse engineering. The project was delivered on time and on budget.

### Code reviews

I value discussion and code reviews. I like having conversations that challenge reasoning and exercise discernment between personal and evidence-based opinions. Writing and reading thoughtful feedback made me and my colleagues grow and become more confident.

For example, I used to work closely with a junior developer. We got along well and were assigned to multiple projects together. She was intelligent and capable, but her lack of experience undermined her confidence. I was more experienced, but also doubted my own abilities.

Reviewing her pull requests, I elaborated on reasons and provided evidence, being careful to criticise her code without criticising her as a person, and acknowledging what she got right. I also encouraged her to take increasingly more difficult tasks, while reassuring her that I was around in case of trouble.

She also reviewed my code and challenged my decisions, pushing me to be increasingly more objective and less opinionated.

Both of us benefited from this relationship. She grew more independent and confident in her own abilities, and started delivering key features in projects. I refined my technical and communication skills, and also became more confident in myself.

### Testing

One notable skill we developed during reviews was testing.

We spent time making tests concrete, human-readable documentation, examples of what the actual code is supposed to do, noticing how making them abstract and DRY often went in the opposite direction, making it harder to understand each other.

Also, we observed that tests are at most as good as how much they fail (with tests that never fail being no good at all), and started being more cautious with tautologies, pruning meaningless tests and making better use of time.

## Cover letter

Dear hubbers,

I hope you are doing well in this pandemic. I’m writing to submit my application to the “Software Engineer – App Core” position. I’m confident that I have the skills and that the role is what I’m looking for.

I'm a passionate self-taught hacker with diverse experience. I learned my first programming language, C, when I was 12, and worked my way doing things from scratch, such as implementing complex mathematical algorithms for video games and developing a whole GNU/Linux distribution.

Working as a full stack Ruby on Rails developer for 6 years, delivering excellent results and constantly improving myself, I had a rapid career progression. Two years ago, I moved from Brazil to the UK looking for new challenges.

I believe that GitHub is a place where I’ll find interesting challenges, capable colleagues and a diverse and inclusive culture, where I’ll perform my best, do meaningful work and become an even better professional.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Best regards,  
Pudim
