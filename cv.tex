\section{Projects}
\cventry{2018--Now}{Em edificação}{}{}{}{
	Game about a singer/minister on a quest against religious
	fundamentalism. Features it's own implementation of a \x{Sequential
	Impulse} solver for real-time \x{physics simulation}. Written in \x{C},
	with \x{libSDL}. Artwork done with \x{Gimp}. Runs natively on
	\x{GNU/Linux} and \x{Android}, or on any platform with \x{modern
	browsers} --- thanks to \x{Emscripten}. Native ports to \x{Windows},
	\x{OSX}, \x{iOS} and \x{game consoles} are planned. Source code to be
	GPL'd when the game is released\dots{}

\cventry{2006--Future}{Teh Engine(s)}{}{}{}{
	A series of 3D game engines inspired by \x{Quake}, with the latest
	version featuring a \x{Solid leaf BSP Tree} compiler for efficient
	collision detection. Taught me a lot about \x{data structures},
	\x{algorithms}, \x{linear algebra} and \x{computational geometry}, even
	leading me to start a graduation in Mathematics. Written in \x{C} with
	\x{libSDL} and \x{OpenGL}. 3D modelling in \x{Blender}. The earliest
	version still compiles today.\\

\cventry{2006--2011}{Rogix/Gordax}{}{}{}{
	\x{GNU/Linux distro} for x86 inspired by the \emph{Linux from Scratch}
	book, motivated by an insatiable desire to control one's own computer
	and make everything \x{perfect}. Co-developed with a friend and
	activelly used by me as my main OS for about 5 years, until the host
	computer passed away. It was a 32/64 bit \x{multilib} system featuring
	a \x{X11} graphical environment, it's own \x{package manager} and
	\x{shellscript framework} to build software from source, custom
	\x{bootscripts} and many hacks. A very intense experience. Some of it
	was salvaged from my colleague's backup and can seen on Github:\\
