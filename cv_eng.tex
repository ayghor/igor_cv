\section{Summary}
\cvitem{}{%
	I'm a self-taught programmer and math student who loves elegant
	solutions to real problems. I use \emph{Linux} and write code in
	\emph{C} since age 12 ($\approx 17$ years ago) and have been working
	with \emph{Ruby} and \emph{Rails} in the last 5 years. I believe that
	technology should be simple and useful. I'm interested in \emph{Free
	Software}, \emph{Videogames}, \emph{Machine Learning}, teaching and
	playing guitar.
