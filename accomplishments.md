## 1 - Moved from Brasil to the UK to work as a developer

Got a job at a reputable software/design agency in London and moved from Brasil within a couple of weeks. Quiting my previous job was awesome, but I think what I enjoyed the most was exploring a new world and reinventing myself. I applied to a job overseas in the search for fairer working conditions. What made me feel good about it was that I overcame some material, mental and emotional barriers, and grew up more independent.

## 2 - Influenced the design of a public healthcare system to be less transphobic

Influenced the design of a public healthcare system I worked on, to allow (transgender) patients to customize the way they'll be addressed by the system, even if they haven't undergone a legal name change. I can't say it was pleasure to articulate this, but I think I had some ejoyment in doing it. My motivation was my own experience and of friends', who are systematically disrespected at essential services such as hospitals. For example: when I last got a sick note from my GP, it had all the feminine pronouns I selected in the multiple occasions they asked, all of them strikedthrough, replaced by the masculine Mr, which I never selected. It's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but it was something I had the power to influence, but I faced my fear of being discriminated against for proposing it and it worked!

## 3 - Made my own GNU/Linux distribution from scratch

Developed a GNU/Linux distribution, loosely based on the Linux From Scratch book, which I used for 5 years. I enjoyed systematizing the work itself and writing tools to facilitate it, like a buildscript framework and a package manager. When I did it, I wanted to be a grown up hacker and have full, unrestricted control over my computer. And what made me feel good was the feeling of freedom I got from this deep dive, feeling that I was capable of exploring the depths of the computer where many grown ups wouldn't dare go.

1 - Rogix/Gordax
================

## What you accomplished?

Developed a GNU/Linux distribution, loosely based on the Linux From Scratch
book, which I used for 5 years.

## What about it you enjoyed the most? (doing)

I enjoyed systematizing the work itself and writing tools for it, like the
buildscript framework and the package manager.

The LFS book guides the reader into building the software from sauce, but after
a couple of examples, it becomes evident that most of them follow very similar
structure and procedures that could be abstracted and automatized, and that
doing so would allow huge benefits such as allowing easy rebuilds and updates.

## What motivated you to do it?

I wanted to be a Hacker and have full, unrestricted control over my computer, I
wanted to really know stuff.

## What made you feel good about it?

The feeling of freedom I got from this deep dive, that I was capable of going
to depths of the computer where I found out many of the grown-up hackers
wouldn't dare.

## What strengths/skills you demonstrated?

* audacity
* self-determination
* self-motivation
* analytical thinking
* critical thinking
* creativity
* planning and organizing
* technical skills
* leadership


2 - Implementar BSP
===================

## What you accomplished?

Implemented a 3D BSP tree compiler and renderer for use in my game engine.

## What about it you enjoyed the most? (doing?)

Studying the algorithm, running it in my mind to understand it, and being
creative with how I would implement it.

## What motivated you to do it?

In part I wanted to make this virtual reality myself, so I could shape and
program it however I felt like. I also wanted to be a _legendary_ programmer
like John Carmack... but at some point it was just because I was hypnotized by
the cleverness of the data structure.

## What made you feel good about it?

Pride and elegance mostly, the mathematician's fulfillment.

It was the most challenging piece of code I had written, and it was quite a
feat for a ~19 years old learning everything by themselves.

And it was an elegant and historical one, that turned square time into
logarithmic and made it possible for regular PCs to run 3d games ~ it sent me
in the direction of mathematics and still fascinates me today.

## What strengths/skills you demonstrated?

* _audacity_
* self-motivation
* self-determination
* analytical thinking
* math skills


3 - Implementar sequential impulse y BVH
========================================

## What you accomplished?

Implemented an AABB, 3D sequential impulse solver and BVH tree for use in my
game engine.

## What about it you enjoyed the most? (doing?)

The same as with BSP, studying, making thought experiments and programming.

## What motivated you to do it?

Same as BSP, I wanted to make a virtual reality from ground up. But this time,
I started by AABB collision 

## What made you feel good about it?

Again, pride and elegance.

Another hard piece of mathematics to understand and write into code, and this
time it connected more dots with my bigger programming and maths experience.

## What strengths/skills you demonstrated?

* self-motivation
* self-determination
* analytical thinking
* math skills


4 - Learning how to program
===========================

## What you accomplished?

Learned my first programming language, C, back in 2000, at age 12, from an
online computer science textbook by UFMG university.

## What about it you enjoyed the most? (doing)

I enjoyed making the computer do things for me, both for a practical purposes
and for pure amusement!

## What motivated you to do it?

I wanted to be a Hacker, write computer viruses and have full, unrestricted
control over computers.

## What made you feel good about it?

The freedom and capacity of going to the depths of the computer, something I
found out most of my colleagues and even adults would deem too complicated and
out of their intelectual reach.

## What skills/abilities you demonstrated?

* audacity
* self-determination
* self-motivation
* analytical thinking

5 - Bhaskara Monster
====================

## What you accomplished?

Passed the 7th grade by, together with a colleague, writing a computer program
to solve quadratic equations and exhibiting it during the science exhibition.

## What about it you enjoyed the most? (doing)

Implementing Newton's method for calculating square roots with my previous math
teacher.

Back then I didn't know how to use the sqrt() function from the C library, so I
implemented my own by testing possible values in 0.01 increments, which had
terrible precision and performance.

Seeing this, my previous math teacher helped me, during the exhibition, to
implement to implement a more efficient one using Newton's iterative method.

## What motivated you to do it?

Besides passing 7th grade, which I needed, I think the urge of putting my
recently acquired ability to solve a _real world problem_ ~ we were calculating
those solutions by hand, with pencil and paper, but it could be done by a
computer in a fraction of a second.

## What made you feel good about it?

That I was capable of delivering my first software to save my ass, despite many
people, including one of my math teachers, trying to put me off, saying it
would make no sense as a math project on the science exhibition, or impossible
to accomplish for a kid such as me.

## What strengths/abilities you demonstrated?

* audacity
* self-determination
* self-motivation
* analytical thinking
* critical thinking
* creativity
* leadership
* technical skills


6 - Moved to London
===================

## What you accomplished?

Got a job at a reputable software/design agency in London and moved from
Brasil.

## What about it you enjoyed the most? (doing?)

Quiting my previous job was awesome, but I think exploring a new world and reinventing myself.

## What motivated you do to it?

Fairer working conditions.

## What made you feel good about it?

Defying my material, mental and emotional limitations.

I do have more money and much fairer working conditions now, which is what I
wanted, and needed, and deserved ~ because everyone does ~ but that is just a
fraction of it.

I experienced going far from home, from my friends, from my mom, and living by
myself in a radical way. I experienced being an immigrant, transitioning and
confronting the subalternization of me and others...

Those experiences were life itself happening and I had the guts to confront my
fears, my fantasies, my delusions, and others' as well, and fight for them,
make them happen.

## What strengths/abilities you demonstrated?

* audacity
* self-motivation
* self-determination
* adaptability
* empathy
* communication skills
* solid technical skills


7 - Liderar em Bahackney
========================

## What you accomplished?

Led (motivated) multiple developers during the Hackney's Repairs HUB extension.

## What about it you enjoyed the most? (doing?)

Working with the team, by asking questions and thinking together of hypotheses
to test, workarounds... and experimenting

## What motivated you to do it?

I wanted to deliver the work, but I didn't have the means to do it alone.

## What made you feel good about it?

My determination, technical skill and ability to engage people into the work
were decisive to the success of the job.

## What stengths/abilities you demonstrated?

* _audacity_
* self-determination
* adaptability
* communication skills
* leadership
* teamwork
* solid technical skills
* reverse engineering


8 - Liderar no GSTT
===================

## What you accomplished?

Led and taught a junior developer during the Guy's and St Thomas Remote
Monitoring MVP and Blood Monitoring extension.

## What about it you enjoyed the most? (doing?)

Apart from abusing power and torturing my subordinates, explaining concepts and
motivating them into thinking and resolving things by themselves.

## What motivated you to do it?

I enjoy teaching things, bringing people to the same feeling of power and
freedom I had when I learned them ~ specially to people whose access is denied,
such as women and people of colour.

## What made you feel good about it?

They progressed a lot and delivered important features on the project, and that
was in good part because of my patience to teach, motivate and give
responsibility.

## What strengths/abilities you demonstrated?

* patience
* communication skills
* empathy
* adaptability
* leadership
* teamwork
* solid technical skills

9 - Preferred names no GSTT
===========================

## What you accomplished?

Influenced the design of the GSTT Remote Monitoring application to it to allow
(transgender) patients to customize the way they'll be addressed by the system.

## What about it you enjoyed the most? (doing?)

It was uncomfortable to explain to the team why allowing _preferred names_ is
important and convince them to allow me to do it. Can't say it was a pleasure,
but there might be some joy in it.

## What motivated you to do it?

The disrespect I and others face, that is also manifest into the systems behind
public, essential services.

For example, in a couple of occasions I had to give personal information to my
GP, I checked my title _Miss_ or _Ms_. This was never respected by anyone at
the practice, and even when I later needed a sick note, they made sure to
include multiple feminine titles struckthrough, with _Mr_ at the end of it.

And of course being treated by a name that is not your legal name is not even
an option. Because the service is "made for everyone", it must not contemplate
the needs of anyone.

## What made you feel good about it?

It might not be much, but I articulated with a public health service to be less
transphobic ~ at least some system allows it now.

## What strengths/abilities you demonstrated?

* audacity
* self-motivation
* communication skills
* empathy
* critical thinking
* creativity

10 - MVP do GSTT
================

## What you accomplished?

Delivered my first project as a developer in London, an MVP for the Guy's and
St Thomas Hospital, to remotely monitor rheumatoid arthritis patients.

## What about it you enjoyed the most? (doing)

Working with people to design the software, both in terms of user interface and
source code.

## What motivated you to do it?

It was my job and I wanted to deliver an excellent result, not only because it
was my first project in London, but also because it was to improve a public
health service.

## What made you feel good about it?

I survived my first project very well, learned a lot, earned the trust of my
team, developed a good relationship with the PO and was praised several
times... I put a lot of effort and delivered something excellent, of real
value, to an essential public service ~ I proved I'm competent on international
standards.

## What strengths/abilities you demonstrated?

* adaptability
* communication skills
* solid technical skills
* critical thinking
* creativity
* teamwork

Commit no git
=============

## What you accomplished?

Contributed a patch to allow neovim as a merge tool to one of world's most
famous and important pieces of software.

## What about it you enjoyed the most? (doing?)

Programming and discussing like a grown-up. Initially I supplied a very simple
patch, but then I was challenged by one of git's maintainers to do better ~ It
was fun.

## What motivated you to do it?

I wanted the feature for myself, but also I wanted to exercise my right of
participating in free software and spread my code to pretty much all
developers' computers, put it on my CV and feel that I'm awesome.

## What made you feel good about it?

I managed to get my code into production and it's available for everyone now,
which is great and what I wanted. But more than that, I was well received by
the maintainer and challenged at the same time to do more, and _it felt great
to be accepted and wanted, treated as someone on the same level, and be
requested to do more_.

## What strengths/abilities you demonstrated?

* audacity
* initiative
* self-motivation
* communication skills
* teamwork
* solid technical skills

Tortinhasss
===========

## What you accomplished?

Gathered investment from friends and sold _tortinhasss_ (TM) (cartoon apple
pies) on a hipster fair.

## What about it you enjoyed the most? (doing?)

The planning was really cool, even more than making the pies and shocking
people at the fair with my dress and curly moustache.

Making the spreadsheet to estimate the investment and returns and presenting it
to my friends was funny and my chance to use all the knowledge I acquired
through the linear algebra book I studied (again by myself) to do something
other than 3d graphics.

## What motivated you to do it?

I wanted to experiment having my own business and owning it completely, and
cooking is something I like and do well ~ it's applied chemistry.

## What made you feel good about it?

_I did it my way_ (Frank Sinatra), and it wasn't a failure!

Despite being my first experience at anything like that, I did what I wanted: I
planned, cooked, mobilized friends, and I was there selling the slices of apple
pie.

And it was _imperceptibly profitable_, but still _profitable_: I _repayed my
investors a couple pence more than what they invested_.

## What strengths/skills you demonstrated

* audacity
* leadership
* self-determination
* self-motivation
* initiative
* math skills
* creativity
* entrepreneurship
